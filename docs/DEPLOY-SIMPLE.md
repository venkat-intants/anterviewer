# Deploy Guide (Simple English)

This guide explains how to put the whole project on the internet so anyone can
use it from a web link. No deep technical knowledge needed — just follow the
steps in order.

> **Good news:** this project was already deployed once. The live backend links
> are saved in `web/vercel.json`. So you are either (a) re-using that setup, or
> (b) doing a fresh deploy. This guide covers a fresh deploy from zero.

---

## 1. What we are deploying (in plain words)

The project has **two parts**:

1. **The website** (what users see) — built from the `web/` folder. It goes on **Vercel**.
2. **The backend** (the brain + database work) — 5 small programs. They go on **Railway**.

The 5 backend programs are:

| Program | What it does |
|---|---|
| `data-gateway` | Login, users, privacy/consent |
| `interview-core-api` | Starts and manages interviews |
| `interview-core-worker` | Runs the talking avatar + voice (no web link, works in background) |
| `feedback-billing` | Scores the interview + makes the PDF report |
| `admin-ops` | Admin dashboard data |

They all share **one database** (Neon), **one cache** (Upstash), and **one file
store** (Cloudflare R2). You already have these — the keys are in the `.env` files.

                        [ Neon DB ] [ Upstash ] [ R2 files ] [ LiveKit ]
```

## 2. Things to get ready first

Create free accounts on these (if you don't have them):

- **GitHub** — to store the code: https://github.com
- **Railway** — for the backend: https://railway.app
- **Vercel** — for the website: https://vercel.com

You also need the keys/links that are **already in your `.env` files**:
- Neon database link (`DATABASE_URL`)
- Upstash cache link (`REDIS_URL`)
- Cloudflare R2 keys (`S3_*`)
- LiveKit project (`LIVEKIT_URL`, key, secret)
- Gemini, Sarvam, Tavus/Simli keys

Keep those `.env` files open — you will copy values from them.

---

## 3. Put the code on GitHub

If the code is not on GitHub yet:

1. Make a new **private** repository on GitHub (call it `anterviewer`).
2. In a terminal inside the project folder, run:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "ready to deploy"
   git branch -M main
   git remote add origin https://github.com/<your-username>/anterviewer.git
   git push -u origin main
   ```

Now Railway and Vercel can read your code.

> **Important:** the `.env` files have real passwords/keys. Before sharing the
> repo with anyone, see Section 9 (rotate secrets).

---

## 4. Deploy the 5 backend programs on Railway

Do this **once per program** (5 times). It sounds like a lot but each one takes
~2 minutes.

1. Go to Railway → **New Project** → **Deploy from GitHub repo** → pick your repo.
2. After it adds the first service, open the service **Settings**:
   - **Root Directory:** `/`  (leave as the repo root — do not change it)
   - **Dockerfile Path:** `services/data_gateway/Dockerfile`
3. Click **Deploy**.
4. To add the next program: in the project, click **New** → **GitHub Repo** →
   same repo → set its **Dockerfile Path** to the next one below.

Use these Dockerfile paths, one per service:

| Service name to type | Dockerfile Path |
|---|---|
| `data-gateway` | `services/data_gateway/Dockerfile` |
| `interview-core-api` | `services/interview_core/Dockerfile` |
| `feedback-billing` | `services/feedback_billing/Dockerfile` |
| `admin-ops` | `services/admin_ops/Dockerfile` |
| `interview-core-worker` | `services/interview_core/Dockerfile` |

**Special setting for the worker only** (`interview-core-worker`):
- It has **no web link**. In its Settings, turn **OFF** "Generate Domain".
- Set its **Start Command** to:
  ```
  python -m app.worker.interview_worker start
  ```
- Turn on **"Never sleep" / always running**.

> Tip: there is also a `render.yaml` file in the project. If you prefer
> **Render** instead of Railway, you can import that one file and it creates all
> services for you. The rest of this guide assumes Railway.

### 4b. Coding exams use JDoodle (no extra setup)

Coding exams run the candidate's code through **JDoodle**, a hosted API — so
there is **nothing extra to deploy**: no Piston, no VM, no special container.
It works on Railway, Render, or any host.

You only need free JDoodle credentials:

1. Sign up at https://www.jdoodle.com/ → open **Compiler API** → subscribe to the
   **Free** plan (200 runs/day, no card).
2. Copy your **Client ID** and **Client Secret**.
3. In Railway, on the `data-gateway` service, set:
   ```
   EXECUTION_PROVIDER     = jdoodle
   JDOODLE_CLIENT_ID      = <your client id>
   JDOODLE_CLIENT_SECRET  = <your client secret>
   ```

That's it — MCQ exams, coding exams, and interviews all work with just the 5
backend programs.

> Note: the free tier is **200 runs/day**, and each hidden test case is one run.
> Fine for demos; for big exam batches you'd upgrade JDoodle or self-host the
> Piston engine later (it's kept as a fallback via `EXECUTION_PROVIDER=piston`).

---

## 5. Add the settings (environment variables)

Each backend program needs its settings. In Railway, open a service →
**Variables** → add them. The values come from that service's `.env` file.

**Set these the SAME on all 5 programs:**

```
DATABASE_URL      = (from .env — the Neon link)
DATABASE_SSL      = require
REDIS_URL         = (from .env — the Upstash link)
JWT_SECRET        = (the SAME secret on all 5 — copy from one .env)
JWT_ALGORITHM     = HS256
APP_ENV           = production
LOG_LEVEL         = INFO
CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS = https://YOUR-SITE.vercel.app   (fill in after Step 8)
```

**Then copy the rest** of each program's own values from its `.env` file
(for example `interview-core` needs the `LIVEKIT_*`, `SARVAM_*`, `TAVUS_*`
keys; `feedback-billing` needs `GEMINI_API_KEY`, etc.).

The fastest way: open the service's `.env`, copy each line, and paste into
Railway's Variables (Railway has a "Raw Editor" where you can paste many lines
at once).

---

## 6. Set up the database tables (run once)

The database starts empty. Run the setup command **one time** on the
`data-gateway` service.

In Railway, open `data-gateway` → **Settings** → run a one-off command (or use
the Railway CLI):

```
alembic -c alembic.ini upgrade head
```

Wait until the logs say `Running upgrade ...`. This creates all the tables.

> Do this **before** users try to log in, or login will fail.

---

## 7. Check the backend is alive

Each web program (not the worker) gets a link like
`https://data-gateway-production-xxxx.up.railway.app`.

Open this in your browser (add `/health/live` at the end):
```
https://<data-gateway link>/health/live
```
You should see: `{"status":"alive"}`. Do this for all 4 web programs.

For the **worker**, there is no link — check its **Logs** in Railway. You should
see a line like `interview-worker — starting worker`.

---

## 8. Deploy the website on Vercel

1. Go to Vercel → **Add New Project** → import your GitHub repo.
2. Settings:
   - **Root Directory:** `web`
   - **Build Command:** `npm run build`
   - **Output Directory:** `dist`
3. Add these **Environment Variables** in Vercel:
   ```
   VITE_API_BASE_URL       = /api/gateway
   VITE_INTERVIEW_API_URL  = /api/interview
   VITE_FEEDBACK_API_URL   = /api/feedback
   VITE_ADMIN_API_URL      = /api/admin
   VITE_LIVEKIT_URL        = (your LiveKit wss:// link)
   VITE_USE_MOCK           = false
   ```
4. Open `web/vercel.json` and make sure the 4 links point to **your** Railway
   programs. Replace each `https://...up.railway.app` with your real Railway
   links (gateway, interview, feedback, admin). Save and push to GitHub.
5. Click **Deploy**.

When it finishes, Vercel gives you a link like `https://your-site.vercel.app`.
Go back to Railway (Section 5) and put that link into `CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS`
on all 5 programs, then redeploy them.

> **Why the `/api/...` links?** The website talks to the backend through Vercel,
> which quietly forwards the request to Railway. This keeps the login cookie
> working. You do **not** put the Railway links in the `VITE_` settings — only
> in `web/vercel.json`.

---

## 9. Make yourself the admin

After everything is running, make your account the owner/admin. On the
`admin-ops` service in Railway, run this one-off command:

```
python scripts/grant_admin.py support@intants.com
```

(Use your own email if different. First register that email on the website, then
run this command.)

---

## 10. Test the whole thing

Open your Vercel link and go through it like a real user:

1. **Register / log in.**
2. Accept the **privacy consent** popup.
3. Start an **interview** — pick a job, an avatar, a language.
4. The avatar should **appear and talk**, and listen to you.
5. After it ends, open **History** → your **scorecard** with a score + PDF.
6. Log in as admin → open `/admin` → the dashboard should show data.

If all of that works, you are live. 🎉

## 11. Safety before sharing the link publicly

This "demo" setup is fine for showing to colleges/companies, but **before**
giving the link to the public, do these:

- **Change all secrets.** The keys in the `.env` files are in the code history,
  so treat them as exposed. Make new ones (new `JWT_SECRET`, new database
  password, new API keys) and update Railway.
- Keep `APP_ENV = production` everywhere.
- For real users, put **Cloudflare** in front (free) to block attacks — login
  has no rate-limit by itself yet.
- **Note:** this demo stores data outside India, so it is **not** allowed for the
  government (APSSDC) bid. That needs the separate "AWS Mumbai" setup later.

## 12. If something breaks

| Problem | Likely cause | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| Website loads but login fails | DB tables not set up | Run Section 6 (migrations) |
| "CORS" error in browser | Vercel link not in `CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS` | Add it on all 5 services (Section 5) |
| Interview avatar never appears | Worker not running | Check worker logs; set "Never sleep" (Section 4) |
| 404 / "could not load" on a page | Wrong link in `web/vercel.json` | Fix the 4 Railway links (Section 8) |
| A service won't start | Missing a setting | Compare its Railway Variables with its `.env` |
| Coding exam scores 0 / won't grade | JDoodle creds missing/wrong, or 200/day limit hit | Check `JDOODLE_*` vars (Section 4b); check daily credits |
