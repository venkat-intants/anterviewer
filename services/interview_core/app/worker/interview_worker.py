"""Real-time interview LiveKit worker — the AVATAR interview engine.

This is the PROVEN path (verified 2026-05-31: Simli publishes avatar_video +
avatar_audio via the LiveKit server API). The product is an avatar interview
([[feedback_avatar_only_not_voice_first]]) — this worker is that product.

Pipeline (official LiveKit Agents pattern):
    candidate mic --LiveKit--> silero VAD + Sarvam STT --> Groq LLM (interviewer)
        --> Sarvam TTS (bulbul:v3, one bound voice) --> avatar (lip-synced
        video+audio published into the room) --> candidate sees + hears

Avatar provider is selected by ``settings.avatar_provider``:
    "simli"  — Simli real-time avatar (default demo avatar)
    "tavus"  — Tavus real-time avatar (demo-only, US-hosted, no India residency;
               persona must be in echo/livekit mode — see scripts/tavus_setup.py)
    "none"   — No avatar; voice-only (safe fallback / CI)

Per-session config arrives in the LiveKit JOB METADATA (set at dispatch time by
the token/launch endpoint): JSON {"session_id","job_title","language","voice"}.
The worker looks nothing up if metadata is absent — it falls back to safe
defaults so a bare dispatch still runs.

CRITICAL ORDERING (from the official example + our proof): call
``avatar.start(session, room)`` BEFORE ``session.start(agent, room)``. Reversing
it = avatar never publishes video. This ordering is enforced for ALL providers.

Run:  poetry run python -m app.worker.interview_worker dev
Prod: poetry run python -m app.worker.interview_worker start

    Registered-candidate flow

        authenticated candidate's id.  The consent ledger entry was recorded
        when the candidate accepted the DPDP modal (``POST /consent``).

    Guest magic-link flow (primary invite path — ``interview_take.py``)
        ``POST /interview-invite/redeem`` always lazy-provisions a real ``users``
        row for the applicant (``role='guest_candidate'``) and writes
        ``sessions.user_id = guest_user_id`` in the same transaction.  It also
        records a ``dpdp_consent_ledger`` entry for that ``guest_user_id``
        (the applicant's landing-page checkbox tick).  Therefore the ``user_id``
        column is NEVER NULL for live guest sessions and the watchdog CAN and
        SHOULD poll it — returning ``None`` here and silently skipping consent
        re-checking would mean a guest who withdraws consent mid-session is
        never cut off (DPDP §11 violation).

    Returns:
        ``str``  — the ``user_id`` UUID string for a known, live session.
        ``None`` — only for *genuine* no-ops where consent polling is
                   impossible: ``room_name`` is not a UUID, or the session row
                   does not exist (orphaned/CI dispatch).  The watchdog may
                   safely skip polling in these cases.
        ``_CONSENT_RESOLVE_DB_ERROR`` — the DB was reachable on a previous call
                   but a *transient* error occurred on every retry attempt.
                   The watchdog treats this as a fail-closed signal and ends
                   the session rather than recording without withdrawal
                   protection (DPDP §11 fail-safe).

    Retry policy:
        Up to _RESOLVE_CONSENT_MAX_ATTEMPTS attempts with linear backoff of
        _RESOLVE_CONSENT_BACKOFF_SECONDS between retries. This distinguishes a
        genuine transient error (exhausts retries → fail-closed) from a
        permanent "room not found" (returns None immediately, no retries).

    Isolated from ``_lookup_session`` so the consent watchdog can resolve the
    candidate without disturbing that function's stable return tuple.

    Question-count logic (code-enforced, not just prompt):
      - Each ConversationItemAddedEvent with item.role == "user" is one candidate
        answer. We count from 1.
      - After the candidate's MAX_CANDIDATE_ANSWERSth answer: say warm close,

    NOTE (duration accuracy): session_started_at is set here, BEFORE avatar.start()
    and session.start(), so elapsed time includes cold-start setup time (~1-3s).
    This is a known minor overcount; re-architecting it would require a separate
    "first candidate audio" timestamp which adds complexity for negligible gain.

    ADMISSION CONTROL: increments _active_jobs on entry; decrements via the

    Called by the LiveKit framework BEFORE dispatching the job to entrypoint().

    rejection and return a clear HTTP 503 to the candidate instead of silently
    leaving them in a dead LiveKit room with no interviewer.

    Two complementary guards:
    1. Concurrency cap (worker_max_concurrent_jobs > 0): reject when the
       application-tracked active-job counter meets or exceeds the ceiling.
       This is additive to load_threshold: CPU load may look low while
       network I/O (Sarvam streams) or memory fills up, so we enforce both.
    2. Memory estimation (job_memory_limit_mb > 0 AND container_memory_limit_mb
       > 0): if accepting one more job would push the estimated RSS above the
       VM's hard cap, reject pre-emptively.  A spike OOM-kill terminates ALL
       live interviews simultaneously, which is far worse than one polite
       rejection.

    ``settings.worker_max_concurrent_jobs == 0`` disables the concurrency cap
    (not recommended for production; useful for single-job dev testing).
